# Summary
[summar]: #summary

People, groups and applications have to identify themselves, build relations and exchange messages in a secure way. We will call them identities, all are communicating and have their own protocol of communication.

For example Leo and Tom want to create a birthday event. First they need to know each other and build a trusted channel of communication. To be sure they are talking to the right person, they need a global unique identification which can be verified.
