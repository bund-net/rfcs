# Bund RFCs
Many changes, including bug fixes and documentation improvements can be implemented and reviewed via the normal GitHub pull request workflow.

The "RFC" (request for comments) process is intended to provide a consistent and controlled path for new features, so that all stakeholders can be confident about the direction the network is evolving in and consense can be achieved.
